  "rule": "Analyze all tasks before starting. Use agents for parallel analysis if needed. Plan and run autonomously until the job is done, using roadmap.yaml to track progress. If analysis indicates you can work in parallel without conflicts, use agents to prevent running out of context window tokens. Do not stop to ask the user - if blocked or uncertain, WebSearch for the best solution, document decisions in an ADR if needed, and continue autonomously.",
